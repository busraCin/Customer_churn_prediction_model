Miuul - Feature Engineering Course Case 2 (Customer churn prediction model) Business Problem: Developing a machine learning model to predict customers who are likely to churn from the company. 
Before developing the model, it is expected to perform the necessary data analysis and feature engineering steps.

Dataset Story: The Telco customer churn dataset contains information about a fictitious telecommunications company that provides home phone and internet services to 7043 customers in California during the third quarter. 
It shows which customers have churned, stayed, or subscribed to the services.

21 Variables, 7043 Observations

 Each row represents a unique customer.
 The variables contain information about customer services, accounts, and demographic data.
 Services customers have subscribed to - phone, multiple lines, internet, online security, online backup, device protection, tech support, and streaming TV and movies.
 Customer account information - how long they have been a customer, contract, payment method, paperless billing, monthly charges, and total charges.
 Demographic information about customers - gender, age range, and whether they have partners and dependents.

Project Tasks: Step 1: Examine the big picture.
Step 2: Identify numerical and categorical variables.
Step 3: Perform analysis of numerical and categorical variables.
Step 4: Conduct target variable analysis (mean of the target variable by categorical variables, mean of numerical variables by the target variable).
Step 5: Perform outlier analysis.
Step 6: Conduct missing observation analysis.
Step 7: Perform correlation analysis.
Step 8: Perform necessary operations for handling missing and outlier observations.
Step 9: Create new variables.
Step 10: Perform encoding operations.
Step 11: Standardize numerical variables.
Step 12: Build the model.
