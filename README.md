# #Miuul - Feature Engineering Course Case 2 (Customer churn prediction model) Business Problem: Developing a machine learning model to predict customers who are likely to churn from the company. 
Before developing the model, it is expected to perform the necessary data analysis and feature engineering steps.

Dataset Story: The Telco customer churn dataset contains information about a fictitious telecommunications company that provides home phone and internet services to 7043 customers in California during the third quarter. 
It shows which customers have churned, stayed, or subscribed to the services.

21 Variables, 7043 Observations
CustomerId: Customer ID
 Gender: Gender
 SeniorCitizen: Whether the customer is a senior citizen or not (1, 0)
 Partner: Whether the customer has a partner or not (Yes, No)
 Dependents: Whether the customer has dependents or not (Yes, No) (Children, parents, grandparents)
 tenure: Number of months the customer has stayed with the company
 PhoneService: Whether the customer has phone service or not (Yes, No)
 MultipleLines: Whether the customer has multiple lines or not (Yes, No, No phone service)
 InternetService: Customer's internet service provider (DSL, Fiber optic, No)
 OnlineSecurity: Whether the customer has online security or not (Yes, No, No internet service)
 OnlineBackup: Whether the customer has online backup or not (Yes, No, No internet service)
 DeviceProtection: Whether the customer has device protection or not (Yes, No, No internet service)
 TechSupport: Whether the customer has tech support or not (Yes, No, No internet service)
 StreamingTV: Whether the customer has streaming TV or not (Yes, No, No internet service) Indicates whether the customer uses the internet service to stream television programs from a third-party provider
 StreamingMovies: Whether the customer has streaming movies or not (Yes, No, No internet service) Indicates whether the customer uses the internet service to stream movies from a third-party provider
 Contract: The contract term of the customer (Month-to-month, One year, Two year)
 PaperlessBilling: Whether the customer has paperless billing or not (Yes, No)
 PaymentMethod: The customer's payment method (Electronic check, Mailed check, Bank transfer (automatic), Credit card (automatic))
 MonthlyCharges: The amount charged to the customer monthly
 TotalCharges: The total amount charged to the customer
 Churn: Whether the customer has churned or not (Yes or No) - Indicates whether the customer has terminated the service in the last month or quarter

 Each row represents a unique customer.
 The variables contain information about customer services, accounts, and demographic data.
 Services customers have subscribed to - phone, multiple lines, internet, online security, online backup, device protection, tech support, and streaming TV and movies.
 Customer account information - how long they have been a customer, contract, payment method, paperless billing, monthly charges, and total charges.
 Demographic information about customers - gender, age range, and whether they have partners and dependents.

Project Tasks: Step 1: Examine the big picture.
Step 2: Identify numerical and categorical variables.
Step 3: Perform analysis of numerical and categorical variables.
Step 4: Conduct target variable analysis (mean of the target variable by categorical variables, mean of numerical variables by the target variable).
Step 5: Perform outlier analysis.
Step 6: Conduct missing observation analysis.
Step 7: Perform correlation analysis.
Step 8: Perform necessary operations for handling missing and outlier observations.
Step 9: Create new variables.
Step 10: Perform encoding operations.
Step 11: Standardize numerical variables.
Step 12: Build the model.
